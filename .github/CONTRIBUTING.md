## Contributing to PWA Webpack Starter Kit

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this Starter Kit. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### I don't care about this whole thing, I just have a simple question!

If you need an answer, you can either:
  1. Open an issue and assign to it the `question` label, or
  2. If you need a faster response, either join [the Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BgcHHE-NwwWNnnnu2Bnl-Q) or [the Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/p3wsk/shared_invite/enQtMzMxNTUwMTg1NzUwLWFjYWZmOTUwM2IxMzVmMDU2ZjdmMTg2NzgxOWU2MTYwYmM2YjNmYjMwYzUxNzM4ZmI2ODVlMWZmMTI5M2IyNWU) and ask your question there

### How can I contribute?

#### Reporting bugs

Before reporting a bug, please make sure it hasn't already been reported by visiting the
[issue section](https://github.com/Dabolus/pwa-webpack-starter-kit/issues).

If the bug you found hasn't been reported yet, create a new issue and assign it the proper label(s).
Besides this, there isn't any specific guideline on how the bugs should be reported, Just be sure
to be as clear as possible when describing it.

#### Suggesting enhancements

Same as the bug reporting. First of all, check if the enhancement has already been suggested.
If it doesn't exist, create a new issue and give it the `enhancement` label, plus any other proper label.

Keep in mind that what you may find useful might be completely useless for other users,
so please, make sure that the enhancement can actually be useful for everyone before proposing it.
If you find that it is actually useful only for you, consider forking the project and implementing that
enhancement just for yourself.

### Styleguides

#### Commit messages

This project follows the [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/),
so make sure to read and use it properly. Besides that, also make sure to include `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]`
in the commit title when only changing documentation.

#### Pull Requests

  - Specify what has been changed/added/removed
  - Write a short and concise title. Be more specific in the description
  - Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
  - Be sure to follow all the project coding guidelines. TSLint will definitely give you a big help with this
  - End all files with a newline
  - Add configuration dependencies as devDependencies, and frontend dependencies as normal dependencies
  - Avoid platform-dependent code
